- [x] Test sandbox functionality with sample code

### âœ… Epic 5: AI Integration Foundation
- [x] Research Claude Code SDK implementation
- [x] Design AI service architecture
- [x] Create type definitions for AI interactions
- [x] Implement security schemas and validation
- [x] Build chat interface components

### âœ… Epic 6: AI-Powered File Editing
- [x] Install and configure Claude Code SDK
- [x] Create AI service with streaming support
- [x] Implement plan/diff/apply workflow
- [x] Build chat interface with AI integration
- [x] Add file operation security guardrails
- [x] Create diff viewer for code changes
- [x] Test AI functionality with real API
- [x] **Fix file creation conflict handling** âœ… (2025-01-08)
  - Updated ChatPanel to check if files exist before creating
  - Added graceful fallback to update existing files
  - Wrapped all file operations in try-catch blocks
  - Ensured individual failures don't stop entire plan execution

## Current Status: Working Prototype Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The website generator is now fully functional with AI-powered website creation:

### âœ… Completed Features
1. **AI-Powered Generation**: Claude generates complete websites from prompts
2. **Real-Time Preview**: Sandpack shows generated sites instantly
3. **File System Integration**: AI creates/updates files in virtual filesystem
4. **Streaming Chat**: Real-time streaming responses from Claude
5. **Complete Workflow**: Chat â†’ Generate â†’ Preview â†’ Edit â†’ Save

### Working Example
Users can now:
- Type "Create a landing page for a startup"
- Watch Claude generate HTML/CSS/JS files in real-time
- See the live preview update automatically
- Edit the generated code with syntax highlighting
- Save projects persistently to IndexedDB

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 with streaming UI
- **AI Integration**: Claude Code SDK with direct API access
- **Preview**: Sandpack for live code execution
- **Editor**: Monaco Editor with multi-file support
- **Storage**: IndexedDB with autosave functionality

## Next Steps (Future Epics)

### Epic 7: Enhanced Preview & Build System
- [ ] Advanced preview modes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Build system integration
- [ ] Hot module replacement
- [ ] Error boundary improvements

### Epic 8: Advanced AI Features
- [ ] Multi-turn conversations with context
- [ ] Code refactoring suggestions
- [ ] Automated testing generation
- [ ] Performance optimization recommendations

### Epic 9: Collaboration & Sharing
- [ ] Project sharing via URLs
- [ ] Export to GitHub/CodeSandbox
- [ ] Template marketplace
- [ ] Community features

## Development Guidelines

### Completed Tasks Protocol
1. âœ… Update this planning.md file after each task
2. âœ… Make git commit with descriptive message
3. âœ… Test functionality thoroughly
4. âœ… Update documentation as needed

### Current Development Focus
- The core functionality is complete and working
- AI integration handles file operations gracefully
- Error handling prevents system breakage
- Ready for user testing and feedback

## Technical Notes

### AI Integration Architecture
- **API Route**: `/api/ai/chat-direct` using direct Anthropic SDK
- **Streaming**: Real-time response streaming to UI
- **Plan Extraction**: JSON parsing from AI responses
- **File Operations**: Safe operations with conflict resolution
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and recovery

### Key Files Modified (Latest Session)
- `components/layout/ChatPanel.tsx`: Enhanced file conflict handling
- `app/api/ai/chat-direct/route.ts`: Streaming API implementation
- `lib/ai/client-ai-service.ts`: Client-side AI service wrapper
